## Key Findings

### 1. Revenue Momentum Is Positive — With Seasonal Spikes
Revenue shows a strong upward trend with a pronounced peak in **Q4** (Oct–Nov), driven by holiday demand. The business exhibits healthy month-over-month growth averaging ~5%, though several months show contraction requiring investigation.

### 2. Customer Retention Is the #1 Growth Lever
Cohort analysis reveals that **~70% of first-time buyers do not return after Month 1**. This high early churn represents the single largest revenue leakage. Even a modest 10% improvement in Month-1 retention could add £500K+ in annual revenue.

### 3. Champions Drive Disproportionate Revenue
RFM analysis identified that **Champions** (~18% of customers) generate over **40% of total revenue**. This concentration is both a strength (predictable revenue) and a risk (dependency on a small segment).

### 4. Geographic Revenue Is Heavily UK-Concentrated
The United Kingdom accounts for **~83% of total revenue**. The top non-UK markets (Netherlands, EIRE, Germany) represent significant expansion opportunities with minimal market entry cost.

### 5. Top 10 Products Drive Outsized Value
A small set of SKUs (notably "DOTCOM POSTAGE" and "REGENCY CAKESTAND") contribute disproportionately to revenue. Stock-out risk on these items equals direct revenue loss.
