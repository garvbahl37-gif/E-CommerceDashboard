# Strategic Recommendations — E-Commerce Analytics

## Recommendation 1: Launch a Month-1 Customer Re-Engagement Program

**Finding:** Cohort retention analysis shows ~70% of first-time buyers never return after their first purchase.

**Recommendation:**
- Implement a 3-touch automated email sequence triggered after first purchase (Day 3, Day 7, Day 14)
- Offer a 10% discount code valid for 30 days to incentivize repeat purchase
- A/B test messaging: product recommendations vs. category-based vs. discount-led

**Expected Impact:** 10% improvement in Month-1 retention → £500K+ additional annual revenue

**KPI to Track:** Month-1 Cohort Retention Rate (target: >35%)

## Recommendation 2: Implement VIP Loyalty Program for Champions

**Finding:** RFM Champions (~18% of customers) contribute ~40% of total revenue. K-Means clustering confirms this high-value segment has distinct purchasing behaviour (high frequency, high monetary, low recency).

**Recommendation:**
- Create a tiered loyalty program (Silver → Gold → Platinum) based on spend thresholds
- Offer exclusive benefits: early access to new products, free expedited shipping, dedicated support
- Assign dedicated account management for top 100 customers

**Expected Impact:** Reduce Champion churn by 15% → protect £2.5M+ annual revenue

**KPI to Track:** Champion Segment Retention Rate, Champion NPS

## Recommendation 3: Build Safety Stock Protocol for Top 10 SKUs

**Finding:** Top 10 products contribute disproportionately to revenue (~20%+ of total). Any stock-out directly translates to lost sales.

**Recommendation:**
- Establish minimum safety stock levels (3 weeks of average demand)
- Set up automated reorder triggers at 70% of safety stock threshold
- Negotiate priority fulfilment agreements with top suppliers

**Expected Impact:** Prevent estimated £200K+ annual revenue loss from stock-outs

**KPI to Track:** Stock-out Rate for Top 10 SKUs (target: <2%)

## Recommendation 4: Expand into Top Non-UK European Markets

**Finding:** UK accounts for ~83% of revenue. The Netherlands, EIRE, and Germany are the next-largest markets with growing customer bases.

**Recommendation:**
- Phase 1: Localize product pages and checkout for DE, NL, IE (language, currency, payment methods)
- Phase 2: Launch targeted Google Shopping and Meta Ads campaigns in each market
- Phase 3: Establish local return/shipping partners to reduce delivery times

**Expected Impact:** 15% growth in international revenue within 12 months

**KPI to Track:** Non-UK Revenue Share (target: >25%)

---

## Recommendation 5: Increase AOV Through Cross-Sell Bundles

**Finding:** Current AOV of ~£790 presents headroom for growth through strategic bundling and upselling.

**Recommendation:**
- Create "frequently bought together" bundles on product pages
- Implement free shipping threshold at £50 above current AOV
- Add "customers also bought" recommendations at checkout

**Expected Impact:** 10% AOV increase → £1.2M+ additional annual revenue

**KPI to Track:** Average Order Value (target: £900+)

---

## Recommendation 6: Optimize Marketing Timing Based on Purchasing Patterns

**Finding:** Revenue peaks between 10AM–2PM, and Thursday is the highest-revenue weekday. Q4 (Oct–Nov) is 2–3x average quarter.

**Recommendation:**
- Schedule email campaigns for 9:30AM delivery (pre-peak window)
- Concentrate paid ad budget during peak hours (10AM–2PM)
- Pre-allocate 40% of Q4 marketing budget by September

**Expected Impact:** +8% campaign conversion rate, +15% Q4 revenue capture

**KPI to Track:** Email Open Rate by Time Slot, Campaign ROAS by Hour

---

## Recommendation 7: Win-Back Dormant and At-Risk Customers

**Finding:** K-Means clustering identified a substantial "Dormant" segment with high past spending but no recent activity. The "At-Risk" segment shows declining engagement.

**Recommendation:**
- Dormant: Launch win-back campaign with "We miss you" messaging + 15% discount
- At Risk: Trigger automated engagement when purchase frequency drops >50% vs. baseline
- For both: Conduct exit survey to identify churn reasons

**Expected Impact:** Recover 10% of dormant customers → £300K+ recovered revenue

**KPI to Track:** Win-Back Conversion Rate, At-Risk Save Rate
