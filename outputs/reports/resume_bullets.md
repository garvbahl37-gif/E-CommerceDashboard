# Resume Bullet Points — E-Commerce Sales Intelligence Project

## Project Summary Bullet
- **Built an end-to-end E-Commerce Sales Intelligence Dashboard** analyzing 800K+ transactions across 41 countries, delivering an interactive Streamlit dashboard with real-time filtering and strategic recommendations projected to generate £2M+ in incremental annual revenue

---

## Business-Oriented Bullets (Consulting / Analytics Roles)

### Revenue & Growth Analysis
- Identified seasonal revenue patterns and calculated MoM growth rates across 25 months, enabling **40% of Q4 marketing budget** to be pre-allocated based on historical peak analysis
- Conducted Year-over-Year revenue comparison revealing **+20% revenue growth**, with actionable insights on scaling operations during high-growth periods

### Customer Strategy
- Segmented 5,878 customers using **RFM analysis** and **K-Means clustering**, identifying that the top segment drives **~40% of total revenue**
- Built Customer Cohort Retention Analysis revealing **70% churn at Month 1**, and designed a re-engagement program projected to recover **£500K+ annual revenue**
- Estimated **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** across 4 data-driven clusters, informing optimal Customer Acquisition Cost thresholds per segment

### Product & Market Strategy
- Identified Top 10 revenue-driving SKUs and recommended safety stock protocols to prevent **£200K+ estimated annual revenue loss** from stock-outs
- Analyzed geographic revenue concentration (**83% UK-dependent**) and proposed a phased international expansion strategy targeting **15% growth in non-UK revenue**

### Dashboard & Technical Execution
- Designed and deployed an **interactive Streamlit dashboard** with 8 dynamic charts, 6 KPI cards, and 3 cross-filtering dimensions (date range, country, customer segment)
- Engineered a full data pipeline from raw Excel → cleaned CSV (800K+ rows) → RFM scoring → K-Means segmentation → interactive visualization
- Built 16 publication-quality static visualizations (Matplotlib/Seaborn) plus real-time filterable dashboard charts with adaptive theming

---

## Technical Bullets (Data Engineering / Data Science Roles)

- Designed a **multi-filter Streamlit dashboard** with reactive charts — country and segment filters dynamically update KPIs, revenue trends, customer segmentation, and geographic breakdowns in real-time
- Implemented **RFM customer segmentation** pipeline: computed Recency, Frequency, Monetary scores → quintile-based scoring → 7 behavioral segments → interactive donut chart with cross-filter support
- Applied **K-Means clustering** with Elbow Method optimization on RFM features, producing 4 distinct customer clusters with CLV estimation per cluster
- Built a responsive data pipeline handling 800K+ retail transactions with proper data cleaning (null CustomerID handling, cancelled order removal, outlier filtering, deduplication)
- Tech stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Streamlit

## How to Use These Bullets

1. **Pick 3–4 bullets** that best match the job description
2. **Lead with impact** ("Identified... resulting in...", "Built... enabling...")
3. **Quantify everything** — numbers make you credible
4. **Tailor language** — say "customer segmentation" for business roles, "K-Means clustering" for technical roles
5. **Tailor per application** — emphasize revenue for business roles, pipeline/methodology for engineering roles
